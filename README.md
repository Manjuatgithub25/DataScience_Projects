## Digit Recoginition
* This project is as the name says predicts digits(0-9).
* The CNN deep learning neural network has been used as image recognition will be more accurate.
* The accuracy of the neural network is approximately 99%
### Hyperparameters
 Hidden layer ctivation method - Relu 
 Output activation method - softmax  
 optimizer - Adam
 loss - categorical cross entropy
