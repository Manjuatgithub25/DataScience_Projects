# DataScience_Projects

## Digit Recoginition
* This project is as the name says predicts digits(0-9).
* The CNN deep learning neural network has been used as image recognition will be more accurate.
* The accuracy of the neural network is approximately 99%
  #### Hyperparameters
  Hidden layer activation method - Relu 
  Output activation method - softmax  
  Optimizer - Adam
  Loss - categorical cross entropy

## House Sale Price
* This project is built to predict house sale price based on 60+ different house and area information.
* The best regression model for this project is selected from comparing 4+ models score which is XGBoost regressor model having 98% training score.
* The chosen best model has silhouette score of 88% which was the best amongst all models as well.
* The best practices for any dataset output prediction has been followed.
